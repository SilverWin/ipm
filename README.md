# Image Pattern Matcher
This module matches image against set of patterns.
It does it with key-features/descriptors, you need only 1 image per pattern or 'class'.
It is good for checking logos on products, so you can use it in some brand-recognition apps.
It is bad for general classification - like telling if there is cat or dog in the picture, for that you probably want to use some trained classifiers.
